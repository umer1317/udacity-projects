# Starbucks Capstone Project


## Project Overview :
Starbucks is one of the word renowned coffee, they have huge variety of hot and cold beverages. They have their main head offices in Seattle, USA. They have IOS and Android mobile applications which allow their customers to order from anywhere in the world.
